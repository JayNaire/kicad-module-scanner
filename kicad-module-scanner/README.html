	<p style="font: bold size:   large" align="center">kicad_module_scanner</p>
	<br>A utility to scan, view and copy Kicad footprint (module)
	libraries.
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Requires:</b>
	<br>Qt sdk (qmake, uic etc.)
	<a href="http://qt.nokia.com/downloads">http://qt.nokia.com/downloads</a><br>
	<br><strike>A Postscript viewer - okular preferred</strike>
	<br>gawk (GNU awk)
	<br>bash + the standard GNU core utilities C++ compiler
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>To compile:</b>
	<br>If not using Eclipse then:
	<br>
	<br>cd /wherever/you/unpacked/the/archive
	<br>check that kicad_module_scanner.pro is in the current
	directory (if it isn't you may need to change to a subdirectory)
	<br>qmake
	<br>make -f Makefile.Release
	<br>
	<br>should produce an executable called kicad_module_scanner
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Test run:</b>
	<br>cd /wherever/you/unpacked/the/archive
	<br>./kicad_module_scanner
	<br>
	<strike>On the General Setup tab the only thing to check is
		the location of the Postscript viewer.</strike>
	<br>
	<br>On the File Scanning tab add a file or files to scan.
	<br>Set the "Output to Database File" to whatever you like.
	<br>Press "Scan Checked Files"
	<br>If all goes well the output file you specify will be created.
	<br>
	<br>Switch to the Viewing tab.
	<br>Check the "Footprint Database" file is the same as you
	specified above.
	<br>Check no search criteria are specified so you see all the
	modules in the library.
	<br>Click Search.
	<br>The Search Results list should fill up.
	<br>Click an item in the list.
	<br>Okular (or whatever you set in General Setup) should spring in
	to life and display the selected footprint. You may need to faff around
	with the viewer to get the best presentation mode, zoom etc.
	<br>
	<br>Once you get comfortable with the basic idea of kms you can
	try scanning whole folders of mod files on the Folder Scanning tab.
	<br>
	<br>Warnings:
	<br>Some features are not fully tested and may fall over with
	"strange" mod files. I have discovered that (very) old footprints used
	different scaling from the "tenth of a mil" used now. kms knows nothing
	about them so be warned! Pins without copper annular rings are holes
	but are not properly dealt with.
	<br>
	<br>Postscript Viewer Notes:
	<br>Pin 1 is always drawn in red - but holes (see above) may mean
	you don't see them as when Pin 1 is actually, say, a heatsink mounting
	hole. Pin Pitch dx, dy dimensions should be accurate; "Footprint XxY"
	are might be wrong sometimes (untested) If refdes or module names look
	daft, don't blame kms. Some mod files on the web are indeed daft. Some
	footprints converted from other PCB programs do not get pin rotation
	correct so they look wrong in kms. (They look wrong in Kicad too.) You
	have to use Kicad's module editor to sort them out.
	<br>
	<br>Enjoy!.
	<br>
	<br>Bob.

	<br>Version: 1.6.1 QT
	<br>This program uses Qt version 4.8.0.
	<br>
	<br>Note: Using a compiled Qt version 4.8.1 gives this compiler
	error:

	fatal error: QtGui/QCleanlooksStyle: No such file or directory this is
	a bug in the Qt install build makefiles as many files in the Qt include
	folder don't get made. The missing files are all capitalised versions
	of .h files (which are correctly installed) eg: QtGui/QCleanlooksStyle
	should be a one line file : #include "qcleanlooksstyle.h"
